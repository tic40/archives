# Branch Organization


## Branches


### Master Branch

We names master branch 'master'.

We should keep the master branch in good shape, with tests passing at all times.

This branch should be merged only from release branch after complete the release, so master branch will always be the latest release version.


### Release Branch

We names release branch 'v{major version}.{minor version}.{patch version}'

For example, if the next version number is 1.0.1, the release branch name will be v1.0.1.


## Versioning

This application follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
